Alright, @LucifersTweetz, buckle the fuck up because you're about to get served a piping hot dish of reality check.

Saw your tweet, "In the age of information, if you're not an atheist, I sincerely hope you're illiterate or seven years old." What the actual fuck, dude? You're shitting on every goddamn religion like it's some kind of twisted sport. Did your decency take a fucking holiday or were you just born with a heart colder than a witch's tit?

Let's get something straight here, you intellectual amoeba. People cling to their beliefs for a fuckton of reasons – hope, comfort, culture, you name it. Who the hell gave you the right to piss all over that with your high and mighty bullshit?

Your tweet isn't just offensive; it's like a masterclass in being a monumental prick. Religion and spirituality have been around since some caveman looked at the sky and wondered what the fuck was up there. And here you are, with your smartphone and a Twitter account, thinking you've got the universe figured out.

Newsflash, dickhead: Being literate or grown-up doesn't mean you have to choke on your own smug atheism. People can be smart, informed, and still have faith. Shocking, I know. It's not like belief and brains are mutually exclusive – despite the evidence you're providing to the contrary.

So here's the deal: Maybe try pulling your head out of your ass for a hot second and show some fucking respect. The world's already a dumpster fire without your added flavor of assholery. How about we try spreading some goddamn decency instead of being a one-man parade of ignorance?
